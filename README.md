iOS SDK
==================

Overview
---------
iOS SDK that can be used to allow the use of the payment gateway within an iOS application.


Requirements

CryptoSwift must be included as a Framework dependency. We have provided CryptoSwift v0.7.2 as part of our SDK however as part of good practice we encourage you to rebuild CryptoSwift and our iOS SDK before use.
